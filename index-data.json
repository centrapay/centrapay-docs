If any line items were purchased by a specific asset, they will be returned on a Payment Request inside the Asset Totals array.\nIntegrators must iterate through the assetTotals array and display any line items purchased to the merchant. Line items that have been purchased via Centrapay must no longer be able to be purchased using another form of payment.\nThis is especially important for any assets which are only redeemable against specific line items. For example, there could be a case where someone used a digital token to pay for a line item, and then a physical voucher to pay for that same line item, which would mean the second voucher could go towards purchasing something other than the intended line item.","href":"/guides/line-items#determining-paid-for-line-items"},"231":{"href":"/guides/loading-and-sending-assets","path":["Reference","Digital Assets","Loading and Sending Assets"],"title":"Loading and Sending Assets","description":"Issue and distribute Centrapay Assets such as Giftcards or Tokens to users via SMS."},"232":{"path":["Reference","Digital Assets","Loading and Sending Assets"],"title":"Loading Giftcards","description":"You can load Giftcards by calling our External Assets endpoint.
