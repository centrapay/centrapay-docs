title: Patron Not Present
---

Centrapayâ€™s Patron Not Present extension allows a merchant to complete a payment when the Patron is not physically present at the time of payment (e.g. phone-based orders).

You can enable this extension by [creating a Payment Request](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#create-a-payment-request) with the `patronNotPresent` flag set to true.

```bash [Request]
curl -X POST https://service.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
