In partnership with Centrapay, Farmlands has two new digital solutions that enable Card Partners to authorise Card payments in real-time, and process invoices to Farmlands faster. There are no transactional costs for Card Partners using these solutions.

Your business can either fully integrate the Farmlands solution to your retail point of sale system, or access a secure web portal when accepting Farmlands Card as a form of payment for a sale anytime, anywhere.
