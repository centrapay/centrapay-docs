[Assets](/api/assets) such as Tokens can be issued by a Centrapay Account. They can then be sent to another Centrapay account using one of the methods described below.

## Requesting Assets

You can request for Assets such as Tokens and Giftcards by calling our [Request Asset Transfers](/api/asset-transfers/#request-an-asset-transfer) endpoint.

For any requests for an asset transfer that is not claimed within 2 weeks, the requested asset transfer will expired.

Asset Transfer Request goes through different lifecycle stages

### Requesting An Asset
Provide the recipient's alias, who is making the request, and the bank account number in the recipientAlias field and the sender's account ID in the senderAccountId field when requesting the asset transfer.
The sender then will be notified via the provided channel.

  <CodePanel title="Request" method="POST" path="/api/asset-transfer-requests">
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://service.centrapay.com/api/asset-transfer-requests \
    -H "X-Api-Key: $api_key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "recipientAlias": "12-1234-1234567-123",
        "senderAccountId": "9EDxUT91TMsUjoqoQeBuLQ",
        "value": "1000",
        "assetType": "quartz.nzd.test"
      }'
  ```
  </CodePanel>

## Sending Assets

You can send Assets such as Tokens by calling our [Create Asset Transfers](/api/asset-transfers/#create-an-asset-transfer) endpoint.

For any asset transfer that is not claimed within 2 weeks, the sent asset will be returned to the sender.

### Sending to Alias
Provide the recipient’s phone number or email in the `recipientAlias` field when creating the asset transfer.
The recipient will be notified via the provided channel.

Use the recipient's phone number for the `recipientAlias` field

  <CodePanel title="Request" method="POST" path="/api/asset-transfers">
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://service.centrapay.com/api/asset-transfers \
    -H "X-Api-Key: $api_key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "assetId": "YGRo6TYYSxH3js7",
      "recipientAlias": "+642212312"
    }'
  ```
  </CodePanel>

Use the recipient’s email for the `recipientAlias` field.

  <CodePanel title="Request" method="POST" path="/api/asset-transfers">
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://service.centrapay.com/api/asset-transfers \
    -H "X-Api-Key: $api_key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "assetId": "YGRo6TYYSxH3js7",
      "recipientAlias": "john.doe@centrapay.com"
    }'
  ```
  </CodePanel>

### Sending via Link
If a `recipientAlias` isn’t provided when creating the asset transfer, a link will be returned in the `url` field, which can then be shared via whichever channel you prefer.
Clicking on the link will open a page to view and claim the asset transfer.

  <CodePanel title="Request" method="POST" path="/api/asset-transfers">
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://service.centrapay.com/api/asset-transfers \
    -H "X-Api-Key: $api_key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "assetId": "YGRo6TYYSxH3js7"
    }'
  ```
  </CodePanel>
