Digital tokens are assets that can be exchanged for specific products or deals. Think a "Free coffee" coupon or a "50% off" voucher.
Unlike assets such as gift cards or currency, tokens can only be spent in their entirety, all at once.

## Token Collection

A collection is a grouping of tokens that share the same attributes and redemption conditions, e.g.

- Name
- Icon
- Expiry period
- Maximum redemption value

## Redemption Conditions

A redemption condition allows a [Merchant](/api/merchants) to accept tokens from a token collection.
It contains redemption details specific to that merchant, e.g. redeemable product SKUs.


## Implementation

``` mermaid

  autonumber
  Token Issuer ->> Centrapay: Create Collection
  Note left of Token Issuer: Confirm redeemable product<br/>IDs with merchant
  Token Issuer ->> Centrapay: Create Redemption Condition
  alt
    Note right of Token Issuer: Create token then send to user
    Token Issuer ->> Centrapay: Create Token
    Token Issuer ->> Centrapay: Transfer Token
  else
    Note right of Token Issuer: Or create token in user's account
    Token Issuer ->> Centrapay: Create Token
  end
```

1. **Create a token collection**

   You can create Collections by calling our [Create Token Collection](/api/tokens#create-token-collection) endpoint. You will need the account identifier of the owning account for the `accountId` field. The `maxValue` field is optional, and defines the upper limit on any settlement amount for a redeemed token.

2. **Create a redemption condition** for each merchant, using the collection Id from step 1

   Redemption Conditions are created by calling the [Create Redemption Condition](/api/tokens#create-redemption-condition) endpoint. You will need the merchant identifier for the `merchantId` field. The list of `allowedProducts` defines those products sold by the merchant that are eligible for redemption. The `sku` for the product will need to match the `sku` that is passed in with the line item when the merchant creates the payment during redemption: [Create Payment Request](/api/payment-requests#create-a-payment-request).

3. **Create tokens**

   Tokens can be created for the collection by calling the [Create Token](/api/tokens#create-token) endpoint.

4. **Transfer the tokens to users**

   You can send Tokens to users by calling our [Asset Transfers](/api/asset-transfers#create-an-asset-transfer) endpoint.

5. **Create tokens directly into users' accounts**

   If you wish to create tokens directly into a user's account, simply provide the user's `accountId` in your [Create Token](/api/tokens#create-token) request.
