Digital tokens are assets that can be exchanged for specific products or deals. Think a "Free coffee" coupon or a "50% off" voucher.
Unlike assets such as gift cards or currency, tokens can only be spent in their entirety, all at once.

## Token Collection

A collection is a grouping of tokens that share the same attributes and redemption conditions, e.g.

- Name
- Icon
- Expiry period
- Maximum redemption value

## Redemption Conditions

A redemption condition allows a [Merchant](/api/merchants) to accept tokens from a token collection.
It contains redemption details specific to that merchant, e.g. redeemable product SKUs.


## Implementation

``` mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  Token Issuer ->> Centrapay: Create Collection
  Note left of Token Issuer: Confirm redeemable product<br/>IDs with merchant
  Token Issuer ->> Centrapay: Create Redemption Condition
  Token Issuer ->> Centrapay: Create Token
  opt
    Token Issuer ->> Centrapay: Transfer Token
  end
```

1. **Create Collection**

    You can create Collections by calling our [Create Token Collection](/api/tokens#create-token-collection) endpoint. You will need the account identifier of the owning account for the `accountId` field. The `maxValue` field is optional, and defines the upper limit on any settlement amount for a redeemed token.

    <RequestCodePanel filename="collections-create" />

2. **Create Redemption Condition** for each merchant, using the collection Id from step 1

    Redemption Conditions are created by calling the [Create Redemption Condition](/api/tokens#create-redemption-condition) endpoint. You will need the merchant identifier for the `merchantId` field. The list of `allowedProducts` defines those products sold by the merchant that are eligible for redemption. The `sku` for the product will need to match the `sku` that is passed in with the line item when the merchant creates the payment during redemption: [Create Payment Request](/api/payment-requests#create-a-payment-request).

    <RequestCodePanel filename="collections-redemption-conditions-create" />

3. **Create Token**

    Tokens can be created for the collection by calling the [Create Token](/api/tokens#create-token) endpoint.

    <RequestCodePanel filename="tokens-create" />

    To create tokens directly into a user account, call our [Create Token](/api/tokens#create-token) endpoint and include the userâ€™s `accountId` in your request.

    <RequestCodePanel filename="tokens-create-with-accountId" />



4. **Transfer Token**

    For sending tokens to users, see [Sending Assets](/guides/loading-and-sending-assets/#sending-assets)
