Centrapay’s Patron Not Present extension allows a merchant to complete a payment when the patron is not physically present at the time of payment (e.g. phone-based orders).

You can enable this extension by [creating a Payment Request](/api/payment-requests#create-a-payment-request) with the `patronNotPresent` flag set to true.

<RequestCodePanel filename="payment-requests-create" optionalFields={["barcode", "lineItems", "patronNotPresent"]} />
