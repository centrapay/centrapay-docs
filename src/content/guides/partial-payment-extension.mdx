Partial Payment is an extension to the Payment Request Protocol that allows
the flexibility for customers to utilize different forms of payment. This allows
Centrapay Payments to easily complement other methods of payment. In addition
leaveraging this with payment methods such as
[Token](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/assets#tokens-experimental) will allow you
to gain valuable insights into customer spending behaviour.

If a customer wants to pay with Centrapay but finds they lack sufficient funds
to cover the full payment, enabling Partial Pay offers a practical solution.
Instead of canceling the Payment Request and starting over, the customer can
make a partial payment using the available funds. Once the payment is successful,
you can proceed to take payment for the remaining balance using another method.

### Create Payment Request

When [creating a Payment Request](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#create-a-payment-request)
you can opt into partial payment by following these steps:

- Set `partialAllowed` to true.
- Set `value.amount` to the amount payable via Centrapay.
- Set `basketAmount` to the total amount of the transaction, including external
forms of payment (e.g., cash or card). This value should be equal to `value.amount`
if the customer is completing their entire transaction using Centrapay.

If the customer has paid by another method or indicates they would like to pay
only a partial amount of the transaction with Centrapay, then `value.amount`
should be less than the `basketAmount`.

If you are integrating with the [Line Items payment extension](/guides/line-items),
the total amount of line items must sum to either the `basketAmount` or the
`value.amount`.

### Get Payment Request

Integrators should continue to poll [get Payment Request](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#get-a-payment-request)
until the status is no longer `new`. If the Payment Request status has been
updated to `cancelled` or `expired`, proceed as describe in [requesting a payment](/guides/requesting-payment#polling-for-payment-confirmation).
If the status is `paid` you need to check the `remainingAmount` property on the
Payment Request.

- If the remaining amount is 0, then the entire amount requested via Centrapay
has been paid.
- If the remaining amount is greater than 0, then the remaining amount must
be paid through means external to Centrapay. If the customer cannot complete
the transaction then the payment request should be [refunded](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#refund-a-payment-request).
