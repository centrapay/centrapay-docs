Partial Payment is an extension to the Payment Request Protocol that allows
customers to pay a partial amount of a payment request using Centrapay.
However, it is the responsibility of the integrating POS to ensure payment of the remaining amount.

## Implementation

```mermaid

autonumber
	opt
		Patron->>POS: Make external payment
	end
	POS->>Centrapay: Create Payment Request (with partialAllowed = true)
	par
		Loop Starts polling for Payment Confirmation
			POS->>Centrapay: Get Payment Request
		end
		POS->>Patron: Connect with Patron
		Patron->>Centrapay: Makes a Payment
		note over POS: Stop Polling for Payment Confirmation
	end
	opt remaining amount > 0
		Patron->>POS: Make external payment
	end
	note over POS: Display Confirmation
```

### Create Payment Request

When [creating a Payment Request](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#create-a-payment-request)
you can opt into partial payment by following these steps:

- Set `partialAllowed` to true.
- Set `value.amount` to the amount payable via Centrapay.
- Set `basketAmount` to the total amount of the transaction, including external
forms of payment (e.g., cash or card). This value should be equal to `value.amount`
if the customer is completing their entire transaction using Centrapay.

If the customer has paid by another method or indicates they would like to pay
only a partial amount of the transaction with Centrapay, then `value.amount`
should be less than the `basketAmount`.

If you are integrating with the [Line Items payment extension](/guides/line-items),
the total amount of line items must sum to either the `basketAmount` or the
`value.amount`.

### Get Payment Request

Integrators should continue to poll [get Payment Request](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#get-a-payment-request)
until the status is no longer `new`. If the Payment Request status has been
updated to `cancelled` or `expired`, proceed as describe in [requesting a payment](/guides/requesting-payment#polling-for-payment-confirmation).
If the status is `paid` you need to check the `remainingAmount` property on the
Payment Request.

- If the remaining amount is 0, then the entire amount requested via Centrapay
has been paid.
- If the remaining amount is greater than 0, then the remaining amount must
be paid through means external to Centrapay. If the customer cannot complete
the transaction then the payment request should be [refunded](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#refund-a-payment-request).
