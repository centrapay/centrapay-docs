[Line Items](/api/payment-requests#line-item) are used to communicate the details of a purchase to a patron.

## Restrictions

1. The price of a Line Item MUST represent the amount that a patron will pay for that Line Item, including tax and any discounts applied (e.g. price = product price * qty - discounts + tax).

    ```json [Example]
    [
      {
        name: 'Cinema Tickets',
        sku: '123456789',
        qty: '2',
        price: '3600', // 2 x $20 + $6 (15% tax) - $10 (discount)
        tax: '15.0',
        discount: '1000' # $10
      }
    ]
    ```

2. The price for each Line Item MUST be provided in cents.
3. The total for all Line Item prices MUST sum to the [Payment Request](/api/payment-requests#payment-request) amount.
4. The currency for each Line Item MUST be consistent with the Payment Request value.
5. The discount for each Line Item MUST be provided in cents and is tax exclusive.
6. A discount that applies to multiple line items may be represented as a separate line item with a negative amount.

    ```json [Example]
    [
      {
        name: 'Cinema Tickets',
        sku: '123456789',
        qty: '2',
        price: '4600' // 2 x $20 + $6 (15% tax),
        tax: '15.0'
      },
      {
        name: 'Popcorn',
        sku: '987654321',
        qty: '1',
        price: '1150', // $10 popcorn + $1.50 (15% tax)
        tax: '15.0'
      },
      {
        name: 'Combo Discount',
        sku: '123456789',
        qty: '1',
        price: '-1500', // $15 (discount)
        tax: '15.0'
      }
    ]
    ```
