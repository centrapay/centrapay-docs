[Line Items](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#line-item) are used to communicate the details of a purchase to a patron.

## Restrictions

1. The price of a Line Item MUST represent the amount that a patron will pay for that Line Item, including tax and any discounts applied (e.g. price = product price * qty - discounts + tax).

    ```json [Example]
    [
      {
        name: 'Cinema Tickets',
        sku: '123456789',
        qty: '2',
        price: '3600', // 2 x $20 + $6 (15% tax) - $10 (discount)
        tax: '15.0',
        discount: '1000' # $10
      }
    ]
    ```

2. The price for each Line Item MUST be provided in cents.
3. The total for all Line Item prices MUST sum to the [Payment Request](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#payment-request) amount.
4. The currency for each Line Item MUST be consistent with the Payment Request value.
5. The discount for each Line Item MUST be provided in cents and is tax exclusive.
6. A discount that applies to multiple line items may be represented as a separate line item with a negative amount.

    ```json [Example]
    [
      {
        name: 'Cinema Tickets',
        sku: '123456789',
        qty: '2',
        price: '4600' // 2 x $20 + $6 (15% tax),
        tax: '15.0'
      },
      {
        name: 'Popcorn',
        sku: '987654321',
        qty: '1',
        price: '1150', // $10 popcorn + $1.50 (15% tax)
        tax: '15.0'
      },
      {
        name: 'Combo Discount',
        sku: '123456789',
        qty: '1',
        price: '-1500', // $15 (discount)
        tax: '15.0'
      }
    ]
    ```

## Determining Paid For Line Items for Partial Payments

Payments via Centrapay can be made against specific line items. This can happen because a user has specifically requested the line items they wish an asset to pay for, or because they were using an asset that can only be redeemed for a specific product like a Centrapay Token.
It's important to communicate to the merchant which line items have been purchased via Centrapay so they are able to make educated decisions when refunding or completing partially paid transactions.
It is also important for reporting to keep track of which assets purchased which line item, this information should be displayed to a consumer on their receipt if possible.
Line items that were purchased by a specific asset, will be returned on a [Payment Request](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#payment-requests) inside the [Asset Totals](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests#asset-total) array.
In order to display this information to a user integrators must iterate through the assetTotals array and display any line items purchased to the merchant. Line items that have been purchased via Centrapay should no longer be able to be purchased using another form of payment.

```json [Example]
  {
    type: 'centrapay.token.main',
    description: 'Centrapay Token',
    settlementDate: '2021-06-28T04:04:27.426Z',
    total: {
      amount: '450',
      currency: 'NZD'
    },
    lineItems: [
      {
        name: 'Coffee Grounds',
        sku: 'GH1234',
        qty: '1',
        price: '450',
        tax: '15.00'
      }
    ]
  }
```
