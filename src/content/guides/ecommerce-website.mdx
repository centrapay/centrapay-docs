eCommerce websites accepting payments via Centrapay may want to redirect their users back to their website after they pay/cancel the payment request. In order to do this, the eCommerce website must add `allowedRedirectUrls` to it’s [Merchant Config](/api/merchant-configs).

After `allowedRedirectUrls` have been added to the Merchant Config, the eCommerce website can simply pass in their `redirectUrl` when creating a [Payment Request](/api/payment-requests).

<RequestCodePanel filename="payment-requests-create" optionalFields={["redirectUrl"]} />
