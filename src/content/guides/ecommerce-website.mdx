Centrapay enables businesses to process payments for connected Centrapay assets online. In order to process payments businesses must be able to integrate with one of our eCommerce payment flows.

## Onboarding

Please contact Centrapay to get your business configured for eCommerce. Centrapay will provide you with an API key and a merchant configuration so you can start [requesting payments](/guides/requesting-payment).

Centrapay will configure your business to accept test payments before configuring you to accept live payments. Accepting live payments requires you to meet our certification requirements.

> You are responsible for the safety of your API keys

### Optional Protocol Extensions

Our payment protocol supports several optional extensions. Please review the extensions below and determine which ones you need for your integration.

- [Line Items](/guides/line-items)
- [Requesting Pre Auth](/guides/requesting-pre-auth)

## Contact Us

Contact integrations@centrapay.com to get started with API keys.

Once you have confirmed your integration needs we will then provide you with a customized integration checklist for certification.
