eCommerce websites accepting payments via Centrapay may want to redirect their users back to their website after they pay/cancel the payment request. In order to do this, the eCommerce website must add `allowedRedirectUrls` to it’s [Merchant Config](/api/merchant-configs).

After `allowedRedirectUrls` have been added to the Merchant Config, the eCommerce website can simply pass in their `redirectUrl` when creating a [Payment Request](/api/payment-requests).

```bash
curl -X POST https://service.centrapay.com/api/payment-requests \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "configId": "5efbe2fb96c08357bb2b9242",
    "value": {
      "amount": "8991",
      "currency": "NZD"
    },
    "redirectUrl": "https://www.example.com/store/checkout"
  }'
```
