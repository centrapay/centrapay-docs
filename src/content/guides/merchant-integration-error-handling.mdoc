Below are our guidelines for dealing with inconsistencies in [Payment Request](/api/payment-requests) statuses due to network issues, race conditions, or [asset](/api/asset-types/) specific behaviours.

## Respect Payment Status

Use the Payment Request status as the source of truth when determining if a Payment Request is paid or expired. For example, if cancelling a Payment Request fails with a `REQUEST_PAID` error then the terminal should respond accordingly; either by showing the transaction as paid or [initiating a void](/api/payment-requests#void-a-payment-request) instead.

### Void Unknown Status

If the status of a transaction cannot be determined to be successful after retrying, then the Payment Request should be voided. [Voiding a Payment Request](/api/payment-requests#void-a-payment-request) will cancel the request and trigger any refunds if necessary.

## Display Error Reasons

Centrapay has a limited set of error messages to simplify integration for our third-party partners.
Due to this, the same error message can be returned for different reasons.
Centrapay provides additional details in the `reason` field to enhance error messages and assist with debugging.
Integrators may choose to display the `reason` to provide more information to the user, however, it is recommended that`reason` is not used to drive application logic.

```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "ERROR_MESSAGE",
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "reason": "A more detailed description of the reason for the error"
}
```

## Configure POS Timeout

Payment Requests have a configurable timeout which defaults to 2 minutes. Integrators should make sure that the payment terminal times out 5-10 seconds **after** the Payment Request.

For example, if the Point of Sale (POS) has a 90-second payment timeout then the Payment Request could be created with an 85-second timeout to prevent the payment terminal from expiring at the same time as the Payment Request is paid.

## Retry Unknown Errors

When faced with an unknown error while checking the status of a Payment Request, POS integrations should retry at least once before voiding the transaction.

> Retries should use the appropriate idempotency key where applicable.

## Resolving Persistent Errors
