The Centrapay API is an [RMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_Maturity_Model)
level 2 RESTful web service which expresses operations in terms of HTTP verbs on
resource-oriented URLs. API endpoint definitions in these docs are grouped by resource
type along with definitions for the associated resource types.

Most API calls require [authentication](/api/auth) using an API key or
JWT. HTTP requests and responses usually have JSON payloads and use
"application/json" as the content type.

Some API features may be flagged as <Badge type="experimental"/>. These API features may be
removed or changed without warning and should not be relied on in a production
setting.
