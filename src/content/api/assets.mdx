Centrapay digital assets are resources that represent the ability for a
Centrapay account to perform transactions where value is exchanged. Assets can
be spent to satisfy [Payment Requests](/api/payment-requests), withdrawn to a bank account via
[Funds Transfers](/api/funds-transfers) and sent to other Centrapay users via [Asset Transfers](/api/asset-transfers).

Assets are categorized as either Money, Gift Cards or Tokens. Depending on its
asset category, an asset will have different attributes available and different
rules governing how it can be obtained, shared or spent.
