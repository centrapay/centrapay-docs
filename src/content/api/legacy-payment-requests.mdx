asset type is the value used to configure the merchant. The ledger param value
is returned with the payment request info as `payments[].ledger`.

  ### Errors

  Voiding a payment request can cause it to be cancelled or refunded. Therefore, this endpoint can give the same error responses as [requests.cancel](#cancel-a-payment-request) and [transactions.refund](#refund-a-transaction).
  After 24 hours voiding a payment request will be disallowed, however a refund can still be made against the payment request if it has been paid successfully.

<Endpoint
  method="POST"
  path="/payments/api/transactions.refund"
>
  ## Refund a Transaction <Badge type="deprecated"/>

  Refunding a transaction can be done with or without an external reference.

  ### Refund without external reference

  If you refund a transaction without providing an external reference, you
  will get a successful response for the first request and then an
  `ALREADY_REFUNDED` message for any refund requests that follow for the same
  transaction, unless an external reference is provided.

  ### Refund with external reference

  If you provide an external reference then a transaction can be refunded
  multiple times provided that the external reference is unique for each
  refund request. When a duplicate external reference is provided when
  attempting to refund the same transaction we return a successful response if
  the amount of the request is the same both times but do not process another
  refund, this is because we assume it to be a repeat request. If the amount
  is different you will get a `REPEAT_REFERENCE` error message.

  ### Refund a Pre Auth Payment Request with Confirmations

  The legacy refund endpoint cannot be used to refund Pre Auth Payment Requests with Confirmations. Please use the [current refund endpoint](/api/payment-requests#refund-a-payment-request) instead.

  ### Attributes
  <Properties>
    <Property name="transactionId" type="string" required>
      The transaction to refund. The transaction id for a payment can be obtained from a webhook notification or from [requests.info](#get-a-payment-request).
    </Property>
    <Property name="amount" type="string" required>
      The amount to refund in cents.
    </Property>
    <Property name="externalReference" type="string">
      A reference supplied by the merchant that must be unique for each refund of that transaction, can be anything you want but it must be unique.
    </Property>

## Webhooks <Badge type="deprecated"/>

Webhook notifications are sent for significant Payment life-cycle
events. The Webhook endpoint is notified by sending an HTTP POST request to the
`notifyUrl` defined in the Payment Request.

### Life-cycle Events That Trigger Webhooks

The supported event types that will be notified to the Payment Requests webhook
and the associated "transactionType" value that will be sent in the payload
are:


| Event Type                | Value of "transactionType" |
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------|
| Payment Request Cancelled | CANCELLED                  |
| Payment Request Expired   | EXPIRED                    |
| Transaction Completed     | PURCHASE                   |
| Transaction Refunded      | REFUND                     |


#### Payment Request Cancelled

A payment request can be cancelled by either calling the [requests.cancel](#cancel-a-payment-request)
or [requests.void](#void-a-payment-request) endpoint before a request has been paid successfully.
When a request has been cancelled we send a JWT that when decoded matches the
*Payment Request Cancelled* example in the Decoded Webhook JWT Examples
section below.

#### Payment Request Expired

A payment request expires two minutes after being created if it hasn't been
cancelled, or paid. When a request has expired we send a JWT that when
decoded matches the *Payment Request Cancelled* example in the Decoded
Webhook JWT Examples section below with the `transactionType` set to EXPIRED.

#### Transaction Completed

A transaction is considered complete when [requests.pay](#pay-a-payment-request) is called with
parameters that satisfy a payment request and the request has been paid
successfully. When a transaction has been completed we send a JWT that when
decoded matches the *Transaction Completed* example in the Decoded Webhook
JWT Examples section below.

#### Transaction Refunded

A transaction can be refunded one to many times and each time a transaction
has been refunded successfully we notify the webhook associated with the
original payment request. A transaction can be refunded when
[transactions.refund](#refund-a-transaction) has been called for a partial or full refund, or when
[requests.void](#void-a-payment-request) is called for a request that has been paid. When a
transaction has been refunded we send a JWT that when decoded matches the
*Transaction Completed* example in the Decoded Webhook JWT Examples section
below but with `transactionType` set to REFUND.

### Webhook Payload

The body of the webhook is a JSON document with the following format:

<CodePanel>
  ```json
  {
    "token": "${JWT}"
  }
  ```
</CodePanel>


The decoded JWT will contain a `transaction` property with a `transactionType`
that indicates the event type. Depending on the type of event, the payload will
also contain additional details about the transaction and payment request. For
example:

<CodePanel>
  ```json
  {
    "transaction": {
      "transactionType": "REFUND",
      "request": {
        "requestId": "bec358bf-edb5-4633-a785-a95cc281d3b7",
        "denomination": {
          "asset": "NZD",
          "amount": "100"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</CodePanel>

#### Webhook Payload Fields

| Property        | Description                                                 |
|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| transactionId   | Id of the transaction                                       |
| transactionType | Indicates which event triggered the notification message    |
| state           | Current state of the transaction                            |
| ledger          | The ledger at which the authorization was processed         |
| amount          | Transaction amount in the lowest denomination available     |
| createdAt       | Timestamp at which the request was created                  |
| updatedAt       | Timestamp at which the request was updated                  |
| type            | The payment type used by the issuer to reconcile settlement |
| request         | Request object, see details at [requests.info][]            |
| authCode        | Authorization code used to settle this transaction          |

### Webhook JWT Validation

A webhook JWT can be validated by checking the signature against the Centrapay
Webhook public key:

<CodePanel>
```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEt+vW2fE0mLLmdzJtYrz7J9q/yEXl
gmIjCXdv3VNvYfTsaBO5PJNiaD3l9lD8PzEQu31ePsOG81mDVuo40+dgLg==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```
</CodePanel>
