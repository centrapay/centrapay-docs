## Timestamp

A point in time, usually with millisecond precision, represented as an
[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date string (eg "2021-06-11T02:51:11.000Z"). Timestamps
are in the UTC timezone as denoted by the "Z" suffix.

## BigNumber

A number, represented as a String, which can have arbitrary size or precision.
Most Centrapay APIs that deal with transactable value (ie. assets, payments,
etc) represent the value as BigNumbers. Depending on the context, a BigNumber
may be used to represent an integer or a decimal amount.

## Monetary

A monetary amount in a currency, represented as an Object. The amount is
usually an integer in the smallest denomination for the currency (ie cents) but
may be a decimal value for some currencies (eg Bitcoin). The currency is
typically represented as an [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) code.

The format is `crn:{account}:{type}:{id}` where "account" is the optional
Centrapay account that owns the resource, "type" is the resource type, and "id"

CRN is often used to refer to Users and API keys. For example:
* **User:** crn::user:e2837e88-d408-11eb-8eac-3e22fb52e878
* **API Key:** crn:1234abc:api-key:MyAccountOwner
