A funds transfer represents either a top up to or a withdrawal from a Centrapay wallet. Topping up a wallet consists of making a bank transfer from the user's bank account to Centrapay. Once Centrapay has verified the transfer was successful a user will be given credit on their Centrapay wallet equal to the amount of the bank transfer.
