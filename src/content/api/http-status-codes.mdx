Centrapay APIs respond with 200, 400, 401, 403, 404, or 429 HTTP status codes.
In rare cases endpoints may respond with 5xx status codes.

Some legacy or deprecated endpoints may have exceptions to the guidelines
documented here. Any such exceptions will be documented on the endpoints.

## 200 Ok

Everything's ok. Enjoy your well formed response!

## 400 Malformed Request

This is a syntax failure. When you get these back, your application needs to change the way it
behaves in order to get back the resource that you're after.

Don't try again, this is never going to work.

<CodePanel title="Response">
  ```json
  {
    "statusCode": 400,
    "message": "amount is required"
  }
  ```
</CodePanel>

### Debugging
* Make sure you set "content-type: application/json".
* The response body should indicate where the error is
* Make sure your HTTP body fields are set correctly.
* Check your HTTP verb is correct (POST, PUT, GET etc.).
* Check query parameters are set correctly.
* Check path parameters are set correctly.

## 401 Unauthorized

API key or JWT is missing, expired or invalid. Go look at our [Auth](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/auth) documentation.

<CodePanel title="Response">
  ```json
  {
    "statusCode": 401,
    "error": "Unauthorized",
    "message": "Missing authentication"
  }
  ```
</CodePanel>

## 403 Forbidden

A 403 status indicates resource missing, permission denied or
business rule violation.

### Resource missing or permission denied

<CodePanel title="Response">
  ```json
    "statusCode": 403,
    "error": "Forbidden",
    "message": "Forbidden"
  }
  ```
</CodePanel>

* Check the resource id is correct
* Check your user or API key has membership for the account that owns the resource you are accessing.
* Check the role of your user or API key has permission (See [Auth Permissions](https://docs.centrapay.com/api/auth#permissions)).

### Business rule violated

When the resource exists and access is authorized but some other business rule
is violated then a 403 is returned. Additional information will be included in
the "message" field of the response body. The possible values for the "message"
field will be documented on each endpoint.

<CodePanel title="Response">
  ```json
  {
    "statusCode": 403,
    "error": "Forbidden",
    "message": "INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE"
  }
  ```
</CodePanel>

## 404 Route Not Found

Variant on a 400, there's a bug in your code that means you've got a typo in
the URL or HTTP method. Please check against examples in our documentation.

<CodePanel title="Response">
```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Not Found"
}
```
</CodePanel>

## 429 Too Many Requests

Centrapay API rate limits have been exceeded.

<CodePanel title="Response">
```json
{
  "statusCode": 429,
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"
}
```
</CodePanel>

### Debugging
* Check the `Retry-After` HTTP response header for the number of seconds
  before the next request will be accepted.
* Contact integrations@centrapay.com to increase your limits.

## 5xx Server Error

If you get a 500 level error, something has gone wrong on our end. Retrying
should solve the issue. Usually a Centrapay Engineer will investigate but
bug reports are also welcome at integrations@centrapay.com.
