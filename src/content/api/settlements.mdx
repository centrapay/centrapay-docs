A Settlement is created from completed [Payment Requests](/api/payment-requests/) over a specified period for each supported [Asset Type](/api/asset-types/) for each [Merchant](/api/merchants/).

Settlements can only be created if the Merchant has a [Settlement Config](/api/merchants#settlement-config-model).
