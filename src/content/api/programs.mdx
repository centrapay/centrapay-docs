A Program can be used to provide a versatile foundation for diverse organisational requirements.
Comprising three distinct types - `loyalty`, `acceptance` and `retail`.

- **Loyalty Programs** enable organisations to set up Promotions and Reward their customers.
A Consumer can connect with a Loyalty Program to participate in Promotions and earn Rewards.

- **Acceptance Programs** allow organisations to create a new [Asset Type](/api/asset-types) on Centrapayâ€™s platform.
Acceptance Programs allow Merchants to connect with Asset Issuers to accept their Asset Type in-store.
