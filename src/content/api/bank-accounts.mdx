Bank Accounts are used to get money in and out of a Centrapay Account. Money is
moved by creating "Top Up" or "Withdrawal" [Funds Transfers](/api/funds-transfers).

Bank Accounts must be "direct debit authorized" before they can be used for a
Top Up and they must be "verified" before top up funds are released. Bank
Accounts do not require "direct debit authorization" or "verification" in order
to perform a Withdrawal. A 4-digit code from any recent Centrapay-initiated
bank transaction can be used to verify a bank account.
