An Account represents a permission boundary around Centrapay resources.
Accounts can have [API Keys](/api/api-keys/) and [Account Memberships](/api/account-memberships/) which grant access to the resources.

Accounts are classified as either "individual" or "org". Individual accounts
can only have a single member and Centrapay users can only be a member of a single
individual account.
