Payment Requests represent the intention for a merchant to receive payment for goods and services. Payment Requests define the amount to be paid and the Asset Types that are acceptable for payment.

A Payment Request is shared with, and paid by, a patron. The [Payment Flows Guide](/guides/payment-flows/) has more details regarding negotiation of Payment Requests.

Payment Requests have the following statuses:
- `new`: after being created.
- `paid`: after being paid with one or more transactions.
- `cancelled`: after being cancelled or voided by the merchant.
- `expired`: after expiry time is reached without being paid or cancelled.

Payment requests can also be refunded for a short period of time after being paid.

Payment request state transitions can be notified to webhooks.

Centrapay Payment Requests are serviced via two sets of endpoints; the “next” version (documented on this page) and the “legacy” version (documented at [Legacy Payment Requests](/api/legacy-payment-requests)).

---

## Accepted Collections

If a Payment Request contains a `centrapay.token.*` Payment Option, an array of Accepted Collections will be present inside the `centrapay.token` Payment Option.
The Accepted Collections returned can be used to determine if a [Centrapay Token](/api/tokens) can be used to pay a Payment Request, and the Line Items able to be purchased using the Token.

## Payment Condition Model

Some [Asset Types](/api/asset-types) require conditional approval to pay. Possible Payment Conditions include confirming proof of ID
or confirming a promotional item was purchased.

The `conditionsEnabled` flag should be set to true when [Creating a Payment Request](#create-a-payment-request) to indicate that
Payment Conditions can be accepted. If a Payment Condition arises, the absence of the `conditionsEnabled` flag will result in the
Payment Request being cancelled.

Conditions can either be [accepted](#accept-a-payment-condition) or [declined](#decline-a-payment-condition). If a condition is declined,
the Payment Request will be cancelled.
