An asset transfer is an asynchronous exchange of an asset or an amount to a recipient.

A recipient is an existing Centrapay user or someone who can create an account to claim the asset transfer by verifying
their phone number or email.

After an asset transfer is completed the recipientAlias, lastSentTo and
message fields are scrubbed to avoid storing PII.

## Asset Transfer lifecycle

Asset Transfer goes through different lifecycle stages.

  When you send another centrapay user cash or assets, they're automatically assigned to them.
  However, if they're not signed up yet then these assets are not immediately assigned.

  If unclaimed, asset transfers are returned after 2 weeks.

  New accounts should call this endpoint to allocate assets that you've been sent.
