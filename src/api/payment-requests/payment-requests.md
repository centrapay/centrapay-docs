# Payment Requests
{:.no_toc}

Payment Requests represent the intention for a merchant to receive payment for
goods and services.  Payment Requests define the amount to be paid and the
asset types that are acceptable for payment.

A Payment Request is shared with, and paid by, a patron. The [Payment Flows Guide][]
has more details regarding negotiation of Payment Requests.

Payment Requests have the following statuses:

 * **new**: after being created.
 * **paid**: after being paid with one or more transactions.
 * **cancelled**: after being cancelled or voided by the merchant.
 * **expired**: after expiry time is reached without being paid or cancelled.

Payment requests can also be refunded for a short period of time after being paid.

Payment request state transitions can be notified to webhooks.

Centrapay Payment Requests are serviced via two sets of endpoints; the "next"
version (documented on this page) and the "legacy" version (documented at
[Legacy Payment Requests][]).

## Operations

<a name="patron-code"></a>
### Get a Payment Request linked to a Patron Code **EXPERIMENTAL**

Returns the latest Payment Request with status "new" that has been attached to a [Patron Code][].
The Payment Request may have been created with a reference to any Patron Code owned by the user's
account.

This endpoint should be polled just after a user's Patron Code has been scanned. This will allow
them to find the Payment Request and proceed to pay.

curl -X GET "https://service.centrapay.com/api/me/patron-code-payment-request" \
